# Classification Validation Methods and Decision Tree Classification
The aim of these lab assignment was practical experience on how to deploy a multi-class classification tree-based algorithm to classify between different physical activities. My assignment was implemented in MATLAB software in two scripts (main script “task3” and script for function “MeanAndStd”).
There is also file "Task3-4_Report.pdf", which describes the procedure and results in detail.
